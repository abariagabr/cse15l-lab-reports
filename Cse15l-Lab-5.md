## Lab 5
"For this laboratory assignment, I have chosen to undertake Lab 3. My selection of Lab 3 was based on the fact that the assignment focused on researching commands. Specifically, the task required us to consider commands such as less, find, and grep, and to select one of them for further exploration. My chosen command was find.  

To complete this assignment, I was tasked with identifying four interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the find command online. For each of these options, I was required to provide two examples of how they could be used on files and directories within the ./written_2 folder. In order to demonstrate my understanding, I was also required to present each example as a code block, showing the command and its output, and provide a brief explanation of what it accomplishes and its utility.  

By undertaking this assignment, I was able to expand my knowledge and skillset in using the find command effectively."  

For example:-

## `Less -S`

"I am initiating the `less-s` bash command for the purpose of starting the `less` pager program in 'squeeze' mode. The 'squeeze' mode is designed to consolidate multiple blank lines into a single line, allowing for easier readability of text files that contain excessive whitespace or paragraph spacing. This feature is especially helpful when viewing log files or similar text documents.  

It is worth noting that `less -s file.txt` is one of the ways to employ this mode. Using the `less-s` command in this manner enables me to view text files one page at a time, thus improving the ease and convenience of the process while reducing confusion. In summary, the `less-s` bash command is an invaluable tool for optimizing the viewing of text files in 'squeeze' mode." and i'm using this for the `bahamas-History.txt` from lab 3.  

## `Less -N`  

In Bash terminal, it is often necessary to view the contents of files while working on various projects or tasks. One of the commands that can be used for this purpose is `less`. The `less` command is a pager utility that allows you to view the contents of a file one page at a time. It is a powerful tool that can be used to view large files quickly and efficiently.

When working with files that contain many lines of text, it can be helpful to know the line number of a specific line. This is where the `less -n` command comes in handy. This command is used to display the line numbers of a file while viewing it in the `less` pager.

Here's an example command:

`less -n filename.txt.`

This command will open the `filename.tx`t file in the `les`s pager, and display the line numbers for each line of the file. This can be useful for various tasks such as debugging, troubleshooting, or simply keeping track of the number of lines in a file.

It is important to note that there is another command,` nl`, which can also be used to add line numbers to a file. However, the `nl` command does not display the output in a pager like `less`, so you won't be able to navigate through the file in the same way. Instead, the output will be displayed in the terminal window. Therefore, the `less -n` command is often preferred when you need to view the contents of a file with line numbers and navigate through it.

In summary, the `less -n` command is a useful tool for displaying the line numbers of a file while viewing it in the `less` pager. It can be helpful for various tasks such as debugging, troubleshooting, or simply keeping track of the number of lines in a file. While there is another command, `nl`, that can also be used to add line numbers to a file, it is often preferred to use `less -n` when you need to navigate through the file while viewing its contents. and here is some example that I use:-

And if we try this on a different file the task is the same but it has diffrent out put.

In this example, less displays the contents of Algarve-WhereToGo.txt with line numbers on the left-hand side of the terminal screen. The -N option is used to enable the display of line numbers.
