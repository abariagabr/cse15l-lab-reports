## Lab 5
"For this laboratory assignment, I have chosen to undertake Lab 3. My selection of Lab 3 was based on the fact that the assignment focused on researching commands. Specifically, the task required us to consider commands such as less, find, and grep, and to select one of them for further exploration. My chosen command was find.  

To complete this assignment, I was tasked with identifying four interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the find command online. For each of these options, I was required to provide two examples of how they could be used on files and directories within the ./written_2 folder. In order to demonstrate my understanding, I was also required to present each example as a code block, showing the command and its output, and provide a brief explanation of what it accomplishes and its utility.  

By undertaking this assignment, I was able to expand my knowledge and skillset in using the find command effectively."  

For example:-

"I am initiating the `less-s` bash command for the purpose of starting the `les`s pager program in 'squeeze' mode. The 'squeeze' mode is designed to consolidate multiple blank lines into a single line, allowing for easier readability of text files that contain excessive whitespace or paragraph spacing. This feature is especially helpful when viewing log files or similar text documents.  

It is worth noting that `less -s file.txt` is one of the ways to employ this mode. Using the `less-s` command in this manner enables me to view text files one page at a time, thus improving the ease and convenience of the process while reducing confusion. In summary, the `less-s` bash command is an invaluable tool for optimizing the viewing of text files in 'squeeze' mode." and i'm using this for the `bahamas-History.txt` from lab 3.
