## Option: -N (display line numbers)  
This option displays line numbers next to the lines of the file being viewed in less. This can be useful if you want to reference specific lines of the file.So I will do this task for difreent files so we can see the lines diffrence.  


Examples 1:

Examples 2:-  
And if we try this on a different file the task is the same but it has diffrent out put.

## Option: -s (squeeze multiple blank lines into one)  
This option removes extra blank lines in the file being viewed in less. This can be useful if the file has extra blank lines that you don't need to see.  

Examples:  

![-s 0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122565144/221748694-cfdeeb6e-cce2-43eb-b9eb-3a717e043443.jpg)  

![-s 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122565144/221748819-bb3b75bb-4a83-43b0-90a5-264736f3c0f1.jpg)  

## You can use the less command in combination with the grep command to find a specific word in a file.  
So for this example i try to search my name which is ARON and it print the sentence which it has Baron which is my full name on it. So I will try this in different files with two examples.  
## Example 1:-  

![grep name 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122565144/221754037-a3888413-5adc-41d7-9a90-8d7a4c0a423f.jpg) 

## Example 2:-  
Now I try to find Lucayans in the folder and I fond it as you see below.  


![grep name 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122565144/221754094-09134f29-2aa6-47e3-b07f-17e0a7d98f27.jpg)
